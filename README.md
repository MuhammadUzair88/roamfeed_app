RoamFeed — Local Travel Experience Sharing App
RoamFeed provides a community-driven environment where travelers can share real experiences through posts containing images, descriptions, tags, and timestamps. It operates fully offline and stores user-generated data locally using the Hive database. This ensures fast retrieval and smooth user experience independent of network availability.
The application’s UI is designed using Flutter’s Material Design principles, ensuring intuitive navigation, responsive layouts, and platform consistency across devices. State management is handled by Provider, which ensures efficient updates across UI components
